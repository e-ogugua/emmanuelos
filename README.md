## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- Node.js version 18 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager
- Git for version control

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/e-ogugua/emmanuelos.git
cd emmanuelos
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables by copying the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Configure the required environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=your_umami_website_id
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to production
npm run start
```

For deployment to platforms like Vercel:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI and deploy
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

## Design and User Experience

### Visual Design System
The interface uses a glassmorphism design approach with translucent elements and backdrop blur effects. The color scheme emphasizes blue tones for primary actions with supporting colors for different application categories.

### Responsive Design
The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes with responsive grid layouts and mobile-optimized interactions. All components maintain consistent behavior across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Performance Considerations
- Components use React.memo for optimization
- Dynamic imports reduce initial bundle size
- Skeleton loading states provide smooth transitions
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Analytics loading is deferred until after user interaction

## Development Practices

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- ESLint configuration for code consistency
- Prettier for code formatting
- Meaningful commit messages following conventional commits

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Lighthouse performance monitoring
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
